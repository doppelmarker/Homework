"""### Task 5.3 File `data/students.csv` stores information about students in [CSV]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format.
This file contains the studentâ€™s names, age and average mark.

1) Implement a function which receives file path and returns names of top performer students

>>> data_dir_path = Path(Path.cwd(), "../../..", "data")
>>> filename = "students.csv"
>>> filepath = Path(data_dir_path, filename)
>>> get_top_performers(filepath, 5)
['Teresa Jones', 'Richard Snider', 'Jessica Dubose', 'Heather Garcia', 'Joseph Head']

2) Implement a function which receives the file path with students info and writes CSV student information to the new
file in descending order of age.

Result:
student name,age,average mark
Verdell Crawford,30,8.86
Brenda Silva,30,7.53
...
Lindsay Cummings,18,6.88
Raymond Soileau,18,7.27
